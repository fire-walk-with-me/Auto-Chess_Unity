"First-Person Demo" level uses Unity's standard assets (1-st person character and Water4) wich were removed from the package to avoid file conflicts (it is also an Asset Store requirement).

To make the level work properly, please import Standard Assets to your project.

Standard assets are available on the Asset Store: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/#!/content/32351
